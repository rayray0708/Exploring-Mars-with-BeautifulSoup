# web_scraping_challenge

## Description
I've learned to identify HTML elements on a page by their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup. In this project, I will be applying these skills and knowledge to practice. 

First, I used Splinter for automated web-browsing and BeautifulSoup to parse desired information. Subsequently, I stored this information in a Pandas dataframe for data analysis and visualisation. 

## Usage
To see the code for 'Part 1:Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News', navigate to the 'web_scraping_part1&2' folder and select 'part_1_mars_news.ipynb'.

To see the code, data analysis and visualisations for 'Part 2: Scrape and Analyse Mars Weather Data' of the project, navigate to the 'web_scraping_part1&2' folder and select 'part_2_mars_news.ipynb'.

To see the output dataframe for 'Part 2: Scrape and Analyse Mars Weather Data', navigate to the 'web_scraping_part1&2' folder and select 'Output' and choose the 'Mars_temp_df.csv' file.
